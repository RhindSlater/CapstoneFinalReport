					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p class="Paragraph-Content">
							Our capstone project is a website that provides a free platform for buying and 
							selling popular trading cards, starting with Yu-Gi-Oh!. We also 
							provide a point of difference compared to similar sites as we have special one 
							minute ‘blind auctions’, as explained in the abstract.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- propblem statement -->
				<div class="Div-Paragraph" id="Problem">
						<h3>Problem statement</h3>
						<p class="Paragraph-Content">
								The problem that we are helping to solve is that current platforms/websites 
								for buying and selling trading cards are very expensive to use as they usually 
								charge fees for simply using their website. Other problems include, taking a 
								longer time to reach users who do not live close to the country where the cards 
								are sold and do not have user-friendly UI and or UX.
						</p>
					</div>

					<!-- project objective -->
					<div class="Div-Paragraph" id="Objectives">
							<h3>Project objective</h3>
							<p class="Paragraph-Content">
									The objective of our project was to create a platform where users can buy or 
									sell trading cards for free, essentially taking out the ‘middle-man’ with 
									the optional premium service to have them checked if the cards are authentic 
									or fake. This was the product asked for by our product owner.
							</p>
						</div>

					<!-- scope and limitations -->
					<div class="Div-Paragraph" id="Limitations">
							<h3>Scope and limitation</h3>
							<p class="Paragraph-Content">
									The scope of our project was to create an easy to use and functional platform 
									for users to buy and sell cards. This website would also allow users to follow 
									other users, add any card to their wish list or collection, upload their own 
									listings, add other users cards to their watch list or shopping cart, and place 
									a bid on a current auction running. 
									<br>
									Users should also be able to receive notifications when they create an account, 
									when someone buys their listing or lists a card in their wishlist, when someone 
									follows them or requests to trade with them, when you win or lose an auction, 
									when someone removes or edits a listing in your shopping cart or watch list, when
									a purchased card has been successfully verified and when the shipping process 
									has been started.
									<br>
									Users can also send an email to us using the contact us page.
									<br>
									<br>
									Some limitations include, time, resources, knowledge, and skill set variation. 
									Time was a limitation because our team had a large skill gap between our members 
									causing some members to pick up larger workloads to compensate. Another reason 
									was lack of contribution from team members which also required others to work on 
									extra tasks taking time away from their own. This was required to meet deadlines. 
									The skill gap also caused members to lose time while they assisted other members. 
									Resources were a limitation due to no outside funding. This stopped us from making 
									use of faster and more reliable software and hardware.
									<br>
									Another constraint we have is that the website is mainly for people who reside in 
									New Zealand as they benefit the most, while overseas users would end up having the 
									same initial problem as shipping costs of the cards would increase as well as the 
									time it took to reach them.
							</p>
						</div>

					<!-- methodology -->
					<div class="Div-Paragraph" id="Methodology">
							<h3>Methodology</h3>
							<p class="Paragraph-Content">
									Our approach to solving the problem is by providing a free local platform for trading 
									card users to be able to purchase and sell their cards, ideally within New Zealand 
									as we are much cheaper to use than similar overseas platforms and we will be faster 
									with shipping and provide a nice difference with our ‘blind auctions’.

							</p>
						</div>

					<!-- chapter summary -->
					<div class="Div-Paragraph" id="Summary1">
							<h3>Chapter summary</h3>
							<p class="Paragraph-Content">
									The outcomes of our completed MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for our project 
									show that although there are many features still to be added to the whole 
									project, overall we were able to accomplish most of what was planned despite 
									some limitations and constraints and gained experience with collaboration 
									of working in a team with members of varying skill levels.

								We will use our website to create a brand and make money through ad revenue,

								Framework, MSSQL, GitHub, GitKraken and Github Desktop, Two different 
								Yugioh APIs, Stripe API, SmarterASP, 1stdomains, JavaScript, JQuery and AJAX,
								and C#.
								<br>
								The reason we chose to use these tools, applications, languages and IDEs
								are based on familiarity. Our team had all used these technologies and 
								would not have to spend much time learning how to use them in a different
								project. We specifically chose to use Stripe as opposed to Paypal because
								they were easier to setup and took a smaller cut from each transaction. 
								As with the other two APIs used, we chose them based on ease of use, free
								for all to use and they had all the data we needed.

							We chose to make this website with its current business model because in the 
							trading card industry it does not exist yet. All other solutions currently 
							available come with fees attached and we wanted to remove that. By removing 
							the middleman we allow both parties to profit as the seller will be able to 
							sell for the price he wants and the buyer is able to buy the card for what

					<h3>Design</h3>

							To use the website, our system requires a user to navigate through pages, and use drop down 
							lists, buttons, modals, checkboxes and input textboxes for the functionality of the site. (See <a href="#AppendiceA"> Appendix A, </a><a href="#AppendiceB"> Appendix B, </a><a href="#AppendiceC"> Appendix C)</a>
							The software we use supports our outlined business model by being user friendly and adhering 
							to the target audience as requested by the product owner. The datatypes used include a User 
							with many properties and other classes linked to this main class such as wishlist, watchlist, 
							shopping cart, and collection. Some algorithms we implemented were; finding 10% of the total 
							price of a card in order to meet the requested verification price, using for each loops to add 
							every entity needed for a view.

					<h3>Sprint Planning</h3>
					<p class="Paragraph-Content">
							After we finish mapping out our capstone project scope, we will research all the features 
							and how we will implement each task. After we complete researching each feature, our team 
							and product owner will discuss what features are required for our MVP. We will then add all 
							our user stories, features and epics to our backlog along with story points which we will 
							decide on together. Each user story will also get assigned a priority and a risk variable. 
							Next we will define the acceptance criteria for each user story and make sure it meets the 
							INVEST criteria. Once we have added everything to our backlog, we will add the highest 
							priority features to our first sprint. These are tasks that we need done first to be able 
							to start working using the agile methodology.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Implementation -->
				<div class="Div-Paragraph" id="Implementation">
					<h3>Implementation</h3>
					<p class="Paragraph-Content">
							To create our website, we first started by planning how the website would work using 
							coggle and how our data would interact together using lucidchart. We then designed and 
							linked our classes to create our database. Next, starting a local project which we 
							shared across the team by using source control to work on individual tasks using the 
							Agile methodology. After planning out our tasks using Azure DevOps, we made researched 
							estimates on how long tasks could take and how difficult they would be. Later assigning 
							each user story to a member whose skill set suit the task best; Aiming to have even workloads.
							<br>
							Once we finished the majority of our Epics and Stories, we began creating all the controllers
							for the appropriate models and made views based off CRUD procedures as well as using APIs 
							using the technologies mentioned in the abstract, which took the most time. Once we had a 
							working MVP, we had decided to upload our project online to be tested by users.
							<br>
							We used the ASP.NET MVC web structure for our method of creating the website. The framework 
							we used was Entity Framework Code First Migrations so that we could easily implement version 
							upgrades, or downgrade them to the last working version if required.
							<br>
							For source control, different team members used different applications for the pushing and 
							pulling of data but the host was on SmarterASP.
							<br>
							We used these technologies because these were the ones that we had learnt and had the most 
							experience through previous projects.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- chapter summary -->
				<div class="Div-Paragraph" id="Summary4">
					<h3>Chapter summary</h3>
					<p class="Paragraph-Content">
							In summary, our design and implementation was carefully researched prior to creating the designs 
							so that we would likely have less problems to deal with later on, avoiding any bugs earlier on 
							in the project.
							<br>
							Once the designs were implemented, we found that there were only minor issues that were quickly 
							dealt with thanks to the efficient use of technology we decided to use. Most of what we planned 
							for the design ended up coming to be what we wanted and even with extra features to further 
							improve upon the UI and UX of the overall project.
							<br>
							A large part of this was made to be a lot easier by making use of the two APIs that we found 
							while researching resources to cut down on manual work, such as the data from 10,000 different 
							cards which would have normally taken a lot longer to do.
							<br>
					Overall, we feel that we had obtained the planned designs that were set prior to implementing them.

						Our goal was to be able to buy a card from another user without a middle man.

					<h3>Backlog grooming</h3>
					<p class="Paragraph-Content">
						During the course of our project life cycle we went through multiple backlog grooming 
						sessions. These occurred every 2-3 weeks between our product owner and all other group 
						members. Changes we made to our backlog included iteration checks of all features to be 
						added each sprint. As team members came up with features to be added to the project, we 
						would try to fit them into the next sprints while also making sure that they do not 
						exceed the amount of time required for the sprint. For any items in the backlog that 
						were not completed during the assigned sprint, they would get moved into the next sprint 
						with a higher priority starting with those tasks at the top of the new sprint.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="Div-Paragraph" id="SprintReport">
					<h3>Sprint Report</h3>
					<p class="Paragraph-Content">
						We had 5 sprints each lasting 2 weeks starting in Early April. Each bar represents 
						the amount of story points completed during each sprint. (See <a href="#AppendiceE">Appendix E</a>) 
						<br>
						We started off quite well as we were very motivated to start working on a new 
						project together and got a lot of work done. This sprint included a lot of backend 
						setup including, setting up all of our classes and linking them respectively. Creating 
						our database and setting up basic user actions. While we were able to complete our stories 
						based on our user efficiently, we had some trouble incorporating our two yugioh APIs into 
						our project. 
						<br>
						Entering into our second sprint we still struggled to complete user stories related our 
						API’s and couldn’t complete all stories on time which led to having a lower amount of 
						work being turned in. 
						<br>
						In our next sprint we still had small issues but were able to turn in a few high 
						difficulty point stories and a lot of the scheduled work (Not including unresolved 
						user stories from previous sprints.) 
						<br>
						In our fourth sprint, we began to approach our final deadline causing everyone to come 
						together and finish all assigned user stories from this and previous sprints. Our team 
						managed to complete over 80 story points due to working harder and smarter. We were also 
						able to move our database online as well as creating a live running website.
						<br>
						Our current sprint also has a lot of user stories that we managed to resolve before our 
						final capstone project deadline.
					</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Retrospective -->
				<div class="Div-Paragraph" id="Retrospective">
					<h3>Retrospective</h3>
					<p class="Paragraph-Content">
						Sprint 1: We started off very well with all team members having a clear understanding of the
						general outline of the product. We could have improved on having more feasible rated story points 
						for certain tasks. Next time we would like to make more accurate estimates on the difficulty of 
						some tasks.
						<br>
						Sprint 2: We had completed some more of the MVP for our project, however this time we under-estimated 
						the amount of work to be done and could have balanced this sprint a lot better but this was 
						largely due to struggling with unfamiliar APIs. Next time we hope to get a more balanced collections 
						of story points and get more tasks resolved after seeing how the first two sprints went.
						<br>
						Sprint 3: Although not as many stories were handed in as we could have, we managed to hand in 
						higher value stories which further helped to complete the MVP as set out by the product owner. We 
						could have improved on resolving more of the smaller features for a better total sprint outcome. 
						Next time we aim to get the full MVP completed to leave time for the other features as extras depending 
						on how much time is left over.
						<br>
						Sprint 4: In this sprint we had finally managed to complete the entire MVP. We would like to have improved 
						on possibly fitting in even more features and checking and testing for bugs. In the next sprint, which is 
						due after the deadline, we hope to clear out these existing bugs before adding any new features in order 
						of priority.
					</p>
				</div>
	
				<!-- Evaluation -->
				<div class="Div-Paragraph" id="Evaluation">
					<h3>Evaluation</h3>
					<p class="Paragraph-Content">
						Our website is operating as planned but still has some features to add and small 
						hanges to be made. If we had more time we would be able to fix a lot of these minor 
						but noticeable bugs. Although we have these minor problems, our website still manages to solve its purpose.
						<br>
						From our extensive research we found that our website is up to 50% cheaper 
						than other online auction sites in our market location. (see <a href="#AppendiceD">Appendix D</a>) We also include 
						more features that would be very useful to the target audience. Lastly we 
						are the only site that do blind auctions which we believe will be a big selling feature.

								allowing a user to add multiple cards at a time, adding a service worker, 
								implement a faster database/ use more efficient sql queries. I would recommend 
								improving upon our current app by implementing more ajax to update tables, and
